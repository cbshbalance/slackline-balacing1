// DEPRECATED in v5.2 - the closed carrier + bottom lid design was replaced
// by the OPEN carrier: the AS5047P now mounts on a T-shaped bracket screwed
// to the underside of the carrier top bridge.

// This file is kept only so old links don't break; it renders nothing
// (frame_v5.scad prints a deprecation echo for this part_mode).
